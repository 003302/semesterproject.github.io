 <p>In 1861, Abraham Lincoln became the 16th President of the United States.  Before his presidency, he was a lawyer and a politician.
  Abraham Lincoln was born on February, Laure County, KY. 12, 1806. He was later assassinated on April 15, 1865, at the Peterson House,
  Washington D.C. He was one of America’s greatest heroes due to his roles in guiding the Union through the Civil War and working to emancipate 
  enslaved people. His eloquent support of democracy and insistence that the Union was worth saving embody the ideals of self-government 
  that all nations strive to achieve. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves across the Confederacy. Lincoln’s
  rise from humble beginnings to achieving the highest office in the land is a remarkable story, and his death is equally notable. He was
  assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on  April 15, 1865, at age 56, as the country was slowly beginning to reunify following the war.</p>
