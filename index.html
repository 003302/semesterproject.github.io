 <p>In 1861, Abraham Lincoln became the <b>16th President of the United States</b>.  Before his presidency, he was a lawyer and politician.
  Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1806, in Laure County, KY. He was later assassinated on April 15, 1865, at the Peterson House,
  Washington D.C. He was one of America’s greatest heroes due to his roles in guiding the Union through the Civil War and working to emancipate 
  enslaved people. His eloquent support of democracy and insistence that the Union was worth saving embody the ideals of self-government 
  that all nations strive to achieve. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed slaves across the Confederacy. Lincoln’s
  rise from humble beginnings to achieving the highest office in the land is a remarkable story, and his death is equally notable. He was
  assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on  April 15, 1865, at age 56, as the country was slowly beginning to reunify following the war.</p> 

  <p>When Lincoln was 9 years old, his 34-year-old mother died of tremetol, more commonly known as milk sickness, on October 5, 1818. The 
  event was devastating to the young boy, who grew more distant from his father and quietly resented the hard work placed on him at 
  an early age. In December 1819, just over a year after his mother’s death, Lincoln’s father Thomas married Sarah Bush Johnston, a
  Kentucky widow with three children of her own. Although both his parents were most likely illiterate, Thomas’ new wife Sarah encouraged 
  Lincoln to read. It was while growing into manhood that Lincoln received his formal education—an estimated total of 18 months—a few 
  days or weeks at a time.</p>

  <p>In 1834, Lincoln began his political career and was elected to the Illinois state legislature as a member of the Whig Party. More
  than a decade later, from 1847 to 1849, he served a single term in the U.S. House of Representatives. His foray into national politics
  seemed to be as unremarkable as it was brief. He was the lone Whig from Illinois, showing party loyalty but finding few political
  allies. In the November 1860 general election, Lincoln faced his friend and rival Stephen Douglas, this time besting him in a four-way
  race that included John C. Breckinridge of the Northern Democrats and John Bell of the Constitution Party. Lincoln received not quite
  40 percent of the popular vote but carried 180 of 303 Electoral College votes, thus winning the U.S. presidency.</p>
